# job-webcrawler
A simple web crawler designed for unrestricted access job sites. Tested on the site timesjobs.com.

- Filters can be added or removed when as of needed like searching for python jobs or excluding them.
- Conditions can be added like searching for jobs only posted today, etc.
- It prints simple and clean output to a simple text file and can be customized further when needed.
- Can be set up to keep scanning every 30 minutes or any duration when required.
  
Further improvements needed:
- Code needs to be modified further to work on other sites upon bypassing access restrictions.
